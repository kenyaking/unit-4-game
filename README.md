# unit-4-game

Challenge/Problem: A game app that includes hidden data and calculations.

Solution: I created a game where the player is shown a random number at the start of the game. The goals of the game is to match the number shown. Players click on “crystal” buttons that have hidden numbers. As the player clicks the crystals, each number is added to the total. If the player exceeds the random number shown, the player loses the game. If the player matches the number, he wins the game.
